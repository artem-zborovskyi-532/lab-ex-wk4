# Exercise 5: Whereâ€™s that bug!
    # You have just started your placement, and you are given a piece of code to correct.
    # The aim of the script is to take a 2D list (that is a list of lists) and print a list
    # containing the sum of each list. For example, given the list in data, the output
    # should be [6, 2, 10].
    # Modify the code below such that it gives the right result. In addition, you have
    # been asked to refactor the script into a function sum_lists(list_2D) that
    # returns the list containing the sums of each sub-list.
        # data = [[1,2,3], [2], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
        # output =[]
        # total = 0
        # for row in data:
            # for val in row:
                # total += val
                # output.append(total)
        # print(output)

def sum_lists(list_2D: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
    output = []
    for row in list_2D:
        total = 0
        for val in row:
            total += val
        output.append(total)
    return output

data = [[1,2,3], [2], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
print(sum_lists(data))
